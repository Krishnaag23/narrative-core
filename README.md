# Narrative-Core

In a world where the demand for engaging and immersive content is ever increasing, This project aims to stands as a revolutionary AI-driven storytelling system designed to transform brief ideas into rich, consistent multi-episode narratives with meaningful cultural elements.


Following are the problems we wish to tackle through this project :
- Narrative Coherence: The audience is frustrated with plot lines and points that don't go anywhere, weird and inconsistent behaviour of characters across episodes , no emotional depth in the story, minimal character development.

- Cultural Relevance: Incorporating traditional storytelling patterns like Panchatantra frameworks and Ashtarasa emotional arcs for authentic cultural resonance.

- Extended Narratives: Context window limitation in using AI based solution to scale production and cater to the rising demand. Sophisticated contextual compression techniques overcome token limitations, enabling truly expansive storytelling.
