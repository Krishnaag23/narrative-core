  "concept_note": "A weary king in ancient Ujjain is tasked by a mysterious sorcerer to retrieve a corpse hanging from a tree in a haunted forest. Inside the corpse dwells a witty, riddle-spouting spirit (Betaal). Each time the king carries the corpse, the Betaal tells a story ending in a moral dilemma. If the king answers correctly (breaking his vow of silence), the Betaal flies back. The overarching goal is to successfully transport the Betaal to the sorcerer, uncovering the sorcerer's true motive. Themes: Duty, intelligence vs. supernatural, consequences of speech. Inspired by Vikram Aur Betaal legends.",
